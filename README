This is a very simple framework for NodeJS.

Example:

```javascript
    var app = require('../cacao').cacao;

    var home = function(req, res) {
      var context = {'foo': 'bar'};
      return app.render('index.html', context);
    }

    app.routes = {
        '/home': home,
    }

    app.run_server(5000);
```

As you can see, it's very simple and lots of things are still missing for the framework, but it's was built just for learning purposes
